                    INSTALLING ROBOTELL PYTHON MODULES

  The official python-can repositiry does not contain support for the robotell CAN.

But it can be installed from the github repo from:

    https://github.com/hardbyte/python-can

 Just for com,pleteness it is included here in the python can subdirectory. Execute

 python setup.py inistall    (may need sudo if global install needed)

 Remove the pip version before installing from source.
